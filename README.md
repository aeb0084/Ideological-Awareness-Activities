# Ideological-Awareness-Activities

This repository holds all ideological awareness activites used in a number of publications. Please note, These activites are updated in real time following feedback and publication results. Table 1 contains the most up to date versions of all activities available for public use. Table 2 contrain key outcomes and other achievements related to Ideological Awareness curriculum, including those utilizing these activities.

## Activity Descriptions

### Enironmental Injustice
> This activity is the only one still in the early stages, although it will be finished in early December. At the current time, this activity combines predictive graphing with peer-reviewed article critiques and group discussion. Students will be discussing the basic principles of pollution, exposure to chemical releases, and air pollution. This will include specific examples (Flint Water Crisis, Cancer Alley, Uniontown AL, and Cheraw SC). Students will predict pollution and emissions across the United States based on population and compare it with data collected from the CDC to examine which populations are considered to be “at risk”, and discuss how we make decisions about pollution management as a society.  

### Race, Ancestry, and Ethnicity
> Students complete a phylogenetics activity in which they are provided with “averaged photographs”. These are images of humans in which hundreds of photos from a single region of the world are averaged together to produce one image representative from a country. Students are then asked to place the photos on a phylogenetic tree at the current branch locations. This can be done individually or in groups. Students will then work as a class to build an ancestrally correct phylogenetic tree based on DNA sequence. Students will discuss phylogenetics based on morphology vs genetics, and how this relates to the concepts of race (social construct) and ancestry (biological construct). They will then discuss the implications of these terms and our understanding of how they impact their lives. In the lesson, biogeography of human evolution and eugenics will be discussed. 

### The Integration of Evolution and Religion
> Students will be able to define and comprehend cultural competence, acknowledge the limitations of science, and generate effective critical thinking of the given topic when comparing scientific fact vs phenomenons outside of the scientific scope. Students will be provided with a series of examples, and asked to determine if the phenomenon can be explained by scientific inquiry. Students will discuss if they believe the evolution is controversial, and why they feel that way. Students will talk through an example of lenses allow us to perform differential interpretation of the world around us, and there are real lenses, and metaphorical lenses (societally driven). The class will conclude with a discussion on why/how evolution and religion can co-exist, and will include quotes from figureheads within the evolution and religious fields. 

### Tissue Ownership and Biological Ethics
> Students read excerpts on the legality of tissue ownership (ranging from organ donation to biopsied tissues) as well as “The afterward” from the Henrietta Lacks text. It is recommended that you assign the whole Henrietta Lacks text over the period of the semester in order for this to be most productive, but it is not necessary. In place of reading the whole text, a summary of the text may be provided. They first work in groups to build an argument on whether or not people should be compensated for tissues that lead to financial or societal gain in science. Students then take part in a structured debate explaining their view and critically analyzing the opposing view.  

### Genetics of Gender Identity and Sexuality
> In this lesson, students will read articles and chapters written by biologists related to organisms’ sex and sex determination process, access and communicate their prior knowledge, learn the appropriate terminology, and reflect and discuss the implications on both society and scientific communities. This includes the use of a “know, want to know, learned (KWL) chart”, group, and class discussion. 

### Representation in STEM
> In this activity, students read select portions of a research article dissecting representation within introductory science textbooks. Students scan textbooks for graphic depictions of scientists, analyze the themes, draw predictive graphs, and then discuss/critically analyze the results from the peer-reviewed article to compare to their own predictions. Students then design an experiment to test their predictions based on the conclusions of the article. 

### Disparities in Healthcare
> Students will learn about the healthcare disparities among people with historically excluded identities by reading healthcare articles in groups and developing concept maps both individually and collaboratively. Students will have a deeper  understanding of the healthcare field by learning about  the sources, effects, and solutions for healthcare disparities on marginalized communities. Students will know how to  synthesize and connect concepts related to the sources, effects, and solution of healthcare disparities from primary  research. 

### Designer Babies
> Students discuss/debate hypothetical pre-natal gene editing cases in small groups and answer a series of discussion questions. One case is based on medical necessity, and another is cosmetic. They discuss the ethical implications of gene editing and the societal implications. The activity concludes with a class discussion and reflection questions as an assessment.
